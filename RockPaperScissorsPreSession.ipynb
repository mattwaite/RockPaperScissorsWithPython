    "\n",
    "In the last assignment, we learned about functions and lists. In this walkthrough, we're going to add two more tools to our arsenal: External libraries and conditional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "External libraries are code that is not in the standard library that performs a common task. For instance, choosing something at random is a common task, but not so common that it's built into Python's standard library. It's in an external library, conveniently called `random` that helps us choose something at random. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional logic uses terms like `if` and `else` to guide us through decisions. We can puzzle through conditional logic with words -- if this is greater than that, do this. Else, do this other thing. If we need more than one else, we use `elif`, which is the same as saying if this is greater than that, do this, else if that is greater than this, do this thing, else do something completely different. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply these things using a simple game: Heads or Tails. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we do in any Python script is we import the libraries we need. In this case, we need the random library. To import a library we simply do this: "
